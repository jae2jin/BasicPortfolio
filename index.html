            <img src="assets/images/michaya.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="5 Year Anniversary">
            <p>I have 4 older sisters and 2 brothers, My favorite food is Fried Chicken and Ketchup. My
                favorite drink
                is Diet Coke! I
                also love pho which is why I have two restaurants dedicated to the most south east
                noodle soup dish
                called Pho. Because it's "Pho-king" amazing.</p>
            <p>By the way the girl in my profile picture with me is my Beautiful girlfriend, wannabe
                powerlifter, shes
                freaking smart as well. She is in school as a clinical psychologist. But she doesn't
                realize she
                stresses me out and I might need a therapist soon because of her. She also wants to
                marry me. Please Do not take this seriously!</p>
